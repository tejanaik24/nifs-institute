# BRAIN.md — NIFS India Website Rebuild

## ⚠️ Read this first

This file was last updated 2026-07-13 (late pass — interactive centers-map
session, added on top of the evening pass earlier the same day). The
homepage architecture described below is **current as of this update** —
verify with `grep -rn` against `src/app/page.tsx` before trusting anything
that isn't. Two older layers of history are preserved further down for
background only: a "Historical Archive" (July 10 session, scroll-circuit/
R3F architecture, fully replaced) and the immediately-preceding mid-session
brief's blow-by-blow build log (still useful chronology, kept as-is).

## Latest session — 2026-07-13 (interactive centers map)

Two live-feedback items on the `CentersGrid` section (map/HQ block, still
inside the homepage's `SpineLayout`):

1. **`25-years-excellence.png` color mismatch** (in `AboutNifs`, one section
   up) — user didn't like how the cyan/blue AI-generated graphic looked
   against the red spine. **Diagnosed, not yet fixed**: `mix-blend-screen`
   of cyan-on-grey-vignette over saturated red produces a muddy fringe.
   **Recommendation given to user** (not applied — needs regeneration):
   redo the graphic in warm off-white (`#FFF4EE`) numerals with a coral-
   orange glow (`#FF6B4A`–`#FF8552`, adjacent to the existing `--nifs-orange`
   accent) on a **true transparent background** (no grey vignette — that's
   what's producing the muddy wash). Keep `mix-blend-screen` in code once
   the new asset lands; no code change needed beyond swapping the file.
   **Still open** — user hasn't regenerated the image yet.
2. **India-map + centers block rebuilt as fully interactive** (this was
   fully implemented, not just recommended):
   - `src/lib/data/centers.ts` — `Center` type gained `x`/`y` (map
     coordinates, now single-sourced here instead of duplicated in
     `india-map.tsx`) and optional `address` (only Visakhapatnam HQ has a
     verified one — the other 14 centers intentionally have none, no fake
     addresses/phone numbers are ever fabricated). Added
     `hasVerifiedAddress()` helper.
   - `src/components/sections/india-map.tsx` — now a **controlled**
     component (`selectedCity`, `onSelect` props), dots are real `<button>`s
     (a11y), map widened to fill the gutter (`max-w-xl` → `max-w-none`),
     added a radar-sweep + scan-line "futuristic" overlay (both respect
     `prefers-reduced-motion`, mirroring the existing `.map-dot-pulse` /
     `.spine-welcome-ring` guard pattern in `globals.css`). Permanent
     always-on "HQ" tooltip removed — no city is visually privileged by
     default now that the section is pan-India framed.
   - `src/components/sections/center-detail-card.tsx` (new) — the card
     that renders in the spine's previously-unused `center` slot (and
     reused for the mobile fallback below the map, since `SpineSplit`'s
     `center` slot is desktop-only by design). Two branches: verified
     (HQ — full address + Get Directions + Call/WhatsApp) vs. generic
     (other 14 — honest "Contact NIFS HQ for this center's address" copy +
     same Call/WhatsApp CTAs + View All Centers link). Never renders fake
     placeholder data.
   - `src/components/sections/centers-grid.tsx` — owns `selectedCity`
     state, wires it into `IndiaMap` and the spine `center` slot (via
     `AnimatePresence` cross-fade between a placeholder and the populated
     card). **Removed the hardcoded "NIFS Visakhapatnam" HQ-only right
     column** — replaced with pan-India framing ("Find a center near you"),
     kept the 86/24/3+ stat row and the major-centers chip list, made the
     chips clickable too (second path into the same detail-card flow, not
     just the map). Mobile gets its own detail-card render path under the
     map with `scrollIntoView` on selection.
   - Verified end-to-end via `agent-browser` (desktop: map click, chip
     click, both HQ and non-HQ branches all sync correctly; mobile 375px:
     no horizontal scroll, card appears under map, scrolls into view).
     `npm run build` passes clean.
   - Committed + pushed + deployed (`vercel --prod --yes`) — live at
     https://nifs-institute.vercel.app.

**Follow-up fixes, same day** — user flagged three more issues from a live
screenshot after the above shipped:
   - **Map had a lot of dead space** — `india-map-v2.png` (1536×1024) has
     ~23%/9%/20%/9% of transparent padding baked in on L/T/R/B around the
     actual India land mass. Fixed by cropping the *display* (not the
     source file) to the land-mass bounding box via a CSS transform in
     `india-map.tsx` (`CROP_BOX` constant — width/height/position all in
     %, computed from a pixel-scan of the real PNG content bounds with a
     small safety margin so the outline is never clipped). `centers.ts`'s
     x/y values were remapped into this same cropped coordinate space —
     if the map image ever changes, both need recalibrating together.
   - **"Find a center near you" text was touching/overlapping the spine**
     — `SpineSplit`'s gutter columns have zero built-in padding (by
     design, so different sections can choose their own). Added
     `px-6 lg:pr-10 lg:pl-0` (left/map column) and `px-6 lg:pr-0 lg:pl-10`
     (right/text column) directly in `centers-grid.tsx`, mirroring the
     `pl-10 pr-6` / `pr-10 pl-6` pattern `about-nifs.tsx` already uses for
     the same problem. Also gave the "Find a center near you" heading the
     same deep-red (`#7A0F0C`) brand treatment used elsewhere for
     spine-adjacent headlines (was plain foreground color before).
   - **Real bug found during this pass, not user-reported**: switching
     directly from one selected city to another (e.g. Nagpur → Mumbai
     without deselecting first) left the spine/mobile detail card showing
     the *previous* city's data — confirmed via `agent-browser` that
     stale card DOM nodes were silently accumulating (never being
     removed) rather than being replaced. Root cause: `AnimatePresence`'s
     exit animation was never completing on rapid key swaps (`mode="wait"`
     didn't fix it either — the exiting element just never got cleaned
     up). Fixed by dropping `AnimatePresence` for this swap entirely —
     plain conditional rendering keyed by city name remounts instantly
     and correctly; the card's own `motion.div` still plays its enter
     animation. Stress-tested by firing 5 rapid clicks in a row — verified
     exactly one detail card renders each time, no duplicates.
   - Committed + pushed + deployed again — live at
     https://nifs-institute.vercel.app.

### Session — 2026-07-13 (third pass, same day): Placements section + 25-years image, take 2

1. **25-years image swap, attempt 2.** The user regenerated the graphic
   themselves (`25 years orange.png` in Downloads) with the warm
   orange/white-on-transparent palette recommended earlier. **Real gotcha
   hit during this swap**: the exported PNG had **no actual alpha
   channel** (`PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb` — confirmed via .NET
   `Bitmap.PixelFormat`) — the "checkerboard" that looks like a
   transparency indicator in every preview tool was literally baked into
   the file as opaque near-white/light-grey pixels (~246–254 RGB, alpha
   always 255). Swapping the file and just dropping `mix-blend-screen`
   (as planned) rendered a solid white/checkered rectangle on the red
   spine, not a transparent cutout. **Fixed with a custom PowerShell
   script** (`System.Drawing` + `LockBits`) that redraws the source onto a
   real `Format32bppArgb` bitmap, then punches alpha to near-zero for any
   pixel whose minimum RGB channel exceeds ~190 (smooth ramp over ~12
   units) — this reliably separates the near-white checker/glow
   background from the saturated orange numerals (min channel ~64) and
   dark charcoal wordmark (min channel ~84), which stay fully opaque.
   Result: a clean warm-glow cutout on the red spine, wordmark legible.
   **Lesson for next time**: always verify a "transparent" PNG's actual
   `PixelFormat`/alpha channel before trusting a preview tool's
   checkerboard rendering — many export/screenshot tools flatten the
   transparency indicator into real pixels instead of true alpha.
   **Also hit a caching red herring** while iterating: after overwriting
   the file, the dev server kept serving the *old* image across several
   reloads and `.next/cache/images` wipes — even a brand-new Chrome
   profile still showed stale content. Root cause was Next.js dev
   server's in-*process* image-transform cache, not the on-disk
   `.next/cache/images` folder (clearing that alone didn't help) — only
   fully killing and restarting the `next dev` process picked up each
   change. **Lesson**: when a swapped static asset doesn't show up after
   normal cache-busting (query params, `.next/cache` wipe, fresh browser
   profile), restart the actual `next dev` process before assuming
   something else is wrong.
2. **New homepage "Placements" section** —
   `src/components/sections/placements-section.tsx`, inserted between
   `AboutNifs` and `CentersGrid` in `src/app/page.tsx` (homepage is now
   `TunnelHero → SpineLayout(WhyNIFS → AboutNifs → Placements →
   CentersGrid)`). Built from a user-shared screenshot of Amity
   University's "Top Placements" section as a **layout reference only** —
   Amity's own numbers (36,000 placements, ₹2 crore salaries) were never
   used; only NIFS's own verified figures went in. Structure: dark
   (`#111111`) `SpineGutterBg`+`SpineSplit` band (deliberate contrast
   against the white sections around it) — left column: "Career Outcomes"
   copy + 5 real role titles, both reused verbatim from the `/placements`
   page; center spine: a **count-up animated "45,000+ Candidates Placed"**
   stat (first real use of the previously-dead `useCountUp`/`useInView`
   hooks in `scroll-reveal-hooks.ts`) with a soft warm radial-gradient
   glow behind it (deliberately NOT the multi-hue `.spine-welcome-ring`
   conic gradient used elsewhere — tried that first, it read as a messy
   rainbow blob at this size/context, swapped for a plain warm
   `radial-gradient` instead — a single-hue glow suits a stat number,
   the multi-color ring suits the crest/emblem context it was designed
   for); right column: 6 featured recruiter logos (Adani, L&T, ITC, GMR,
   MEIL, Amazon) as bordered white cards + "+12 more recruiting
   partners". Below the split: a full-width scrolling marquee of **all
   18 real recruiter logo images** (`recruiterLogos` from `centers.ts` —
   first time these logo files are used anywhere as images; the existing
   `/placements` page only ever rendered recruiter names as plain text
   tiles) using the already-existing-but-unused `.animate-marquee`
   keyframe in `globals.css`. Mobile gets its own separate `lg:hidden`
   stacked block (same established pattern as `about-nifs.tsx` and
   `centers-grid.tsx` — `SpineSplit`'s `center` slot is desktop-only).
3. **Data-honesty note, important if this section gets extended later**:
   the codebase has several orphaned (zero-import) pre-built components —
   `StatsSection.tsx`, `stats-bar.tsx`, `PlacementWall.tsx`,
   `LogoBar.tsx`, `TrustStrip.tsx`, `salary-outcomes.tsx`,
   `TransformSection.tsx`, `TestimonialsSection.tsx`,
   `CoursesSection.tsx` — containing **fabricated data that must never be
   used as real content**: invented individual student
   names/companies/packages, an unsourced "93% Placement Rate", and
   conflicting placed-counts (45,000 vs 10,000 vs 8,531 elsewhere). None
   of it was used in the new Placements section. They remain on disk
   untouched (matches the project's existing convention of leaving
   unused components as reference, e.g. `ExploreNifs.tsx`) — **do not
   wire any of them into a route without first verifying every number in
   them against a real source**.
4. Verified end-to-end via `agent-browser` at desktop (~1036–1440px) and
   mobile (~500px, Chrome's minimum window width — couldn't get exactly
   375px via window resize on this Windows machine, but confirmed the
   `lg` breakpoint collapse behaves correctly, which is what matters) —
   count-up animates on scroll into view, marquee scrolls with edge
   fades, mobile stacked block renders with no desktop-card duplication.
   `npm run build` passes clean.
5. Committed + pushed + deployed (`vercel --prod --yes`) — live at
   https://nifs-institute.vercel.app.

## ⚡ 30-Second Brief (current, 2026-07-13 end of session)

Rebuilding nifsindia.net as a premium Next.js site for NIFS (National
Institute of Fire and Safety), an Indian industrial-safety training
institute headquartered in Visakhapatnam. **Positioning is industrial
safety first (Safety Officer / HSE Manager / Risk Analyst roles at Adani,
L&T, GMR, ITC, MEIL) — NOT firefighting.** This correction has been made
twice across earlier sessions; don't regress on it, including in generated
imagery.

Live: **https://nifs-institute.vercel.app** (Vercel project `nifs-institute`,
account `tejasolryder24-4493`). Repo: `c:\claude code\nifs-india`, GitHub
`tejanaik24/nifs-institute`. **GitHub→Vercel auto-deploy does not reliably
fire** — after every `git push`, also run `vercel --prod --yes` from the
repo root. **Standing instruction (2026-07-13): always deploy (commit + push
+ `vercel --prod --yes`) immediately after finishing any piece of work in
this repo, without waiting to be asked** — see memory
`feedback-nifs-auto-deploy.md`.

**Homepage today** (`src/app/page.tsx`, updated in the third pass of this
same day — see "Session — 2026-07-13 (third pass" above for what changed
most recently): `TunnelHero` → `SpineLayout` wrapping `WhyNIFS` →
`AboutNifs` → **`Placements` (new)** → `CentersGrid`. `CentersHighlight`
and `ExploreNifs` were both **removed entirely** earlier this session per
explicit user request (see below) — the `ExploreNifs` gap that used to be
flagged as "no replacement content decided" is now filled by the new
`Placements` section, so that open item is resolved.

## Current homepage architecture

`src/app/page.tsx`:
```tsx
<TunnelHero />
<SpineLayout>
  <WhyNIFS />
  <AboutNifs />
  <Placements />
  <CentersGrid />
</SpineLayout>
```

1. **`<TunnelHero />`** (`src/components/sections/tunnel-hero.tsx`) —
   full-viewport scroll-driven image tunnel, 5 real NIFS gallery photos,
   full-bleed frames, headline overlay fades out on frame 0→1. Copy says
   "25+ years of placing graduates..." (updated from "20+" this session,
   see Decision Log). Stays spine-free — explicit, repeated decision.
2. **`<WhyNIFS />`** (`src/components/sections/WhyNIFS.tsx`) — **new this
   session**, repurposed from a previously-built-but-unused component.
   First section after the hero, inside the spine. White background
   (SpineGutterBg), `align="start"` (top-aligned, not vertically centered).
   - **Left column**: "Trained. Placed. Proven." headline (now
     horizontally centered — was flush-left originally, user disliked the
     resulting dead space), body paragraph, a bulleted **"In Technical
     Collaboration With"** card (Annamalai University, Acharya Nagarjuna
     University, State Board of Technical Education AP, Skill India |
     NSDC — bold names, colored bullet dots, tinted highlighted card), then
     "Our Story →" CTA.
   - **Center (spine)**: crest logo + "Welcome to NIFS" + "Why Choose
     NIFS", both lines **typed out character-by-character** (real
     typewriter effect, not a fade/blur) once scrolled into view, plus a
     rotating conic-gradient halo behind the crest. This replaced an
     earlier GSAP scroll-scrub blur/fade version the user explicitly
     rejected ("effects is not impresive... keep typing effect").
   - **Right column**: the 5-item differentiator list (Practical Training
     Yard, Direct Placement Cell, Industry Faculty Only, Government
     Recognized, 86 Centers Nationwide) as bordered hover-cards with
     check icons, in a **2-column grid** (`sm:grid-cols-2`) — was a single
     tall column, which made the section way taller than the left/center
     content and left a large dead-space gap the user flagged twice.
   - Shared scroll-reveal hooks (`useTypewriter`, `useCountUp`, `useInView`)
     live in `src/components/sections/scroll-reveal-hooks.ts`, used by both
     `WhyNIFS.tsx` and `about-nifs.tsx`.
3. **`<AboutNifs />`** (`src/components/sections/about-nifs.tsx`) — white
   background, spine-integrated (was already spine-continuous before this
   session's edits, unchanged there).
   - **Left**: "25+ Years of Excellence in Industrial Safety Education"
     headline (deep red `#7A0F0C`), body para (NSDC/Skill India bold red,
     86 centers).
   - **Center (spine)**: **the user's own AI-generated image**
     (`public/images/25-years-excellence.png`, a blue/cyan "25+ YEARS OF
     EXCELLENCE" graphic) composited with `mix-blend-mode: screen` so its
     grey vignette background disappears into the red spine — no added
     border/card/color from us. This replaced two earlier attempts: a
     plain "ABOUT NIFS" eyebrow, then a from-scratch CSS gradient-numeral
     badge the user rejected ("this is not good, i will generate with ai").
   - **Right**: NSDC + Skill India logos (200×120px, bigger/bolder captions
     than originally) + ISO 9001:2015 badge. Fixed a real overflow bug here
     this session: the two-logo row needed ~556px but its wrapper was
     capped at 380px, clipping the Skill India logo — widened the
     container and added `flex-wrap` so logos stack instead of clipping at
     narrower desktop widths.
   - Mobile stacked block (`lg:hidden`) is separate and mostly untouched —
     still has its own plain "About NIFS" eyebrow (correct/intentional,
     since mobile has no spine to put the fancy badge on).
4. **`<CentersGrid />`** (`src/components/sections/centers-grid.tsx`) —
   **rebuilt this session** from a full-width breakout card into a proper
   3-column spine split (`SpineGutterBg` + `SpineSplit`) matching the rest
   of the site: India map (left) | red spine (center) | Headquarters info +
   stats + major-centers pills + CTAs (right). `align="start"`. No
   duplicate outer section padding (was double-padded with `SpineSplit`'s
   own py at one point — fixed).

**Removed this session:**
- **`CentersHighlight`** (86/24/3+ stats + "Centers Across India & Growing"
  headline/spine section) — deleted from the homepage entirely per explicit
  user request. The component file may still exist on disk unimported;
  don't re-wire it back in without being asked.
- **`ExploreNifs`** (all 5 beats: Academic Training Division, Industrial
  Projects Division, Facilities/"Our Spaces", Practical Training Yard,
  "45,000 Candidates Placed" proof) — deleted from the homepage entirely
  per explicit user request, confirmed via AskUserQuestion (user picked
  "delete all 5 / entire section" and said they have new content planned
  to replace it — **that replacement content was never described**, so the
  page currently just ends after `CentersGrid`). `src/components/sections/
  ExploreNifs.tsx` is left on disk, unimported, in case any of its content
  is reusable for whatever comes next.
- The old `SpineLayout` wrapping was `<SpineLayout><ExploreNifs /></SpineLayout>`
  only; it now wraps `WhyNIFS + AboutNifs + CentersGrid`, so the continuous
  red spine starts right after the hero and runs through all three
  remaining sections (the Kent-parity "continuous spine" goal from the
  previous session's plan — now done, just via a different set of
  sections than originally planned).

## Real facts verified / decided (use these, don't invent numbers)

- **86 Centers in 24 States across India**, recently started in **3 African
  countries** (source: nifsindia.net `/centers/` page body text).
- **25+ years** — changed from "20+ years" to "25+ years" on 2026-07-13 per
  explicit user decision (confirmed via AskUserQuestion after a hand-drawn
  screenshot annotation). Used in `AboutNifs` headline (desktop + mobile)
  and `tunnel-hero.tsx` hero copy (3 occurrences). **Unresolved: the
  arithmetic doesn't reconcile with "Est. 2004"** (2004 + 25 = 2029, a
  future year as of this session's actual date, 2026-07-13) —
  "Est. 2004" was deliberately left untouched since changing the founding
  year wasn't part of what was asked. **Flag this to the user if it comes
  up again** — may be a rounding/marketing choice, or "Est. 2004" itself
  may need revisiting. Don't silently "fix" either number without asking.
- **NSDC approved training partner**, **Skill India** collaboration,
  **ISO 9001:2015 certified** unit of SSB Institute of Higher Studies
  Educational Society — confirmed on the live site, logos in
  `public/images/logos/accreditations/`.
- **Technical collaboration partners** (added 2026-07-13 per explicit user
  confirmation via AskUserQuestion, **not independently verified against
  the live nifsindia.net site** — treat as user-provided fact, not a
  cPanel/live-site-verified one like the centers/states figures):
  **Annamalai University**, **Acharya Nagarjuna University**, **State
  Board of Technical Education AP**, plus the existing Skill India / NSDC
  partnership. Shown in `WhyNIFS.tsx`'s left column.
- **45,000 candidates placed** — came from the MD directly (voice note,
  relayed by user), not independently verified against the old site
  (which showed smaller/conflicting figures like 8,531+ before the
  rebuild). Current source of truth per explicit instruction, but
  provenance is different from the centers/states figures — worth knowing
  if it's ever questioned.
- Old site's course catalogue has 15 programs; new site's `courses.ts` has
  10 — 5 still missing (Diploma in Industrial Safety, Advanced Diploma in
  Fire & Industrial Safety, Chemical Safety cert, Construction Safety cert,
  Advanced Diploma in QHSE). **Not yet added** — untouched this session.

## What the user did NOT like this session (corrections made, don't repeat)

- **Spine invisible / duplicate eyebrow bugs** in the (now-removed)
  `CentersHighlight` and in `AboutNifs`/`CentersHighlight` — outer
  `<section>` had an opaque `bg-background` covering the whole width
  including the transparent spine gutter, and the eyebrow text was
  duplicated once in the spine-center column and once in the content
  column. Root pattern to avoid in future sections: don't put your own
  background on the outer section when using the gutter-bg + spine
  pattern, and only put the spine-eyebrow text in ONE place.
- **The entire `ExploreNifs` section** — user wanted all 5 beats gone,
  no exceptions.
- **Scroll-scrub blur/fade reveal** on `WhyNIFS`'s crest/text — user said
  the effect wasn't impressive and explicitly asked for a literal
  character-by-character typewriter effect instead. Don't default to
  subtle scroll-scrub effects for "wow factor" asks — prefer something
  more literally/obviously animated when the user asks for a "wow" moment.
- **Flush-left "Trained. Placed. Proven."** headline with a big empty gap
  next to it — wanted it horizontally centered in its column.
  **Vertically-centered spine content in a much-taller row** (from the
  tall single-column card list) — wanted it pulled up to the top instead.
  General lesson (saved to memory, `feedback-nifs-spine-section-height.md`):
  when one spine column is much taller than the others (e.g. a long
  stacked list), either compact it (2-col grid — what fixed it here) or
  otherwise balance heights; don't just top/center-align short content and
  accept the dead space.
- **A CSS-built "25 Years of Excellence" gradient badge** — user said "this
  is not good, i will generate with ai" and had me write an image-gen
  prompt instead. Don't over-invest in a from-scratch CSS recreation of a
  branded numeral/badge graphic when the user can generate a real image —
  offer that path earlier for this kind of asset.
- **Cropped Skill India logo** — real layout bug (flex row content wider
  than its container), not a preference issue; fixed with a wider
  container + `flex-wrap`.
- **Plain inline-colored text** for "In Technical Collaboration With..." —
  user wanted actual bullet points, bold university names, and a
  highlighted (tinted card) treatment, not just colored inline spans.
- **General meta-feedback** (saved to memory,
  `feedback-think-innovative-not-blind.md`): "think innovative, dont
  complete work blindly" — apply creative/design judgment rather than
  literal word-for-word execution, especially for visual/design asks.

## Open work / not yet done

- **No replacement content decided for the removed `ExploreNifs` section.**
  The user said they have something planned but never described it. This
  is the most likely next thing to come up — don't assume, ask what it
  should be.
- **"Est. 2004" vs "25+ years" arithmetic inconsistency** (2004+25=2029) —
  flagged to the user once already, unresolved.
- **Content-gap audit items** (142 blog posts / SEO redirects, jobs board,
  5 missing course programs, FAQ page) — still fully unaddressed across
  multiple sessions now.
- **QCFI and other accreditation logos** — recovered via cPanel and
  committed in an earlier session; not re-verified live since the later
  rewrites this session. Worth a spot-check next time you're in
  `AboutNifs`/logos territory.
- Kent-parity items from the previous session's plan that are now
  **effectively done or moot**: continuous spine (done, via WhyNIFS→
  AboutNifs→CentersGrid instead of the originally-planned AboutNifs→
  CentersHighlight→ExploreNifs), `fullWidthStretch()` helper (exists in
  `spine-helpers.tsx`, used by the old CentersGrid before its rebuild —
  check if still needed after the 3-col rebuild), cutout student photos
  inside `ExploreNifs` beats (moot — that section no longer exists).
  Kent's 390px left-sidebar spine for interior/subpages remains
  explicitly out of scope.

## Reference

- **NIFS cPanel + WordPress admin credentials**: saved in Claude's memory
  vault at `Secrets/nifs-cpanel-credentials.md` (not in this repo).
  WordPress `/wp-admin/` is behind a CAPTCHA; cPanel File Manager and the
  public front-end (no login) both work for asset recovery.
- **Kent College reference**: kentcollege.com — structural/design
  benchmark for the spine/cutout-photo visual language. Their real
  signature is cutout (transparent-bg) student photography and a
  continuous spine column, not a dramatic hero — NIFS deliberately keeps
  its dramatic hero (industrial-training audience justifies it) but
  adopted the spine.
- **Standing preferences saved to Claude's memory vault** (apply
  automatically, no need to re-ask): `feedback-nifs-auto-deploy.md` (always
  deploy after finishing work), `feedback-nifs-spine-section-height.md`
  (avoid dead space from mismatched spine-column heights),
  `feedback-think-innovative-not-blind.md` (creative judgment over literal
  execution for design tasks).

## Deployment

**Live**: https://nifs-institute.vercel.app — deploy via `git push` (to
`tejanaik24/nifs-institute`, `main` branch) **followed by**
`vercel --prod --yes` from the repo root (`c:\claude code\nifs-india`) —
the GitHub webhook auto-deploy does not fire reliably, confirmed stalled
3+ minutes multiple times across sessions. `vercel whoami` confirms CLI
auth as `tejasolryder24-4493`, project already linked
(`.vercel/project.json` present). **Do this automatically after finishing
any work here — standing instruction, don't wait to be asked.**

## Session History

### Session — 2026-07-13 (this session)
**Worked on:** Bug fixes (spine visibility, duplicate eyebrows) →
removed `CentersHighlight` → rebuilt `CentersGrid` as a 3-col spine split →
fixed doubled section padding → removed `ExploreNifs` entirely (all 5
beats) → built new `WhyNIFS` welcome section from a previously-unused
component, then iterated on it ~5 times per live feedback (spine
placement, background color, list styling, centering, dead-space, replaced
scroll-scrub with real typewriter effect) → changed "20+" to "25+" years
sitewide → built then replaced a CSS "25 Years of Excellence" badge with
the user's own AI-generated image (blend-mode composited, no added
decoration) → fixed a real Skill India logo clipping bug → restyled the
new "Technical Collaboration" text as a bulleted highlighted list.
**Left off at:** Everything above is built, verified (desktop + mobile
screenshots), committed, and deployed live. No known open bugs.
**Next session should start with:** Ask the user what should fill the
space where `ExploreNifs` used to be (they said they have something
planned but didn't describe it yet) — that's the biggest open item.
Also worth surfacing the "Est. 2004" vs "25+ years" math inconsistency
again if relevant, and the still-unaddressed content-gap audit list
(blog posts, jobs board, 5 missing courses, FAQ page).

# Prior mid-session brief (2026-07-13, earlier in the day) — chronology log

The section below was the brief written mid-session, before the later work
described above (WhyNIFS rebuild, ExploreNifs/CentersHighlight removal,
25-years image, etc.). Kept for its detailed chronology of the hero/tunnel
build and Kent-reference research, which is still accurate background —
just note that several "Open work" items in it have since been resolved,
overtaken, or made moot by the later work above (e.g. "extend the spine
through CentersHighlight → ExploreNifs" — both of those sections are gone
now; the spine instead runs through WhyNIFS → AboutNifs → CentersGrid).

## Why the homepage got rebuilt earlier this session (chronological)

1. **Hygiene audit** (early this session) found the live homepage (then a
   different, earlier build) had a broken CSS bug: a decorative red spine
   element was unbounded and ran the full page height, bisecting content —
   plus duplicate/conflicting stats (85+/10K+ vs 73+/8,531+), redundant
   giant-numeral treatments, and an inconsistent logo wall (QCFI logo was
   `null`, rendering as placeholder text).
2. **Content-gap audit** against the live WordPress site (nifsindia.net)
   found the rebuild was missing: 142 blog posts (SEO risk), a live 23-
   listing jobs board, 5 course programs, an FAQ page, hostel copy, and
   several gallery categories. Not yet acted on — still flagged.
3. **MD gave new direction** (via voice note, relayed by the user): two
   business divisions (Academic Training / Industrial Project) need clear
   representation, "45,000 candidates placed" is the single-source-of-
   truth stat, and facility highlights need surfacing — with a strong
   preference for **less text, more images**. (Note: the Academic/
   Industrial division beats this drove were part of `ExploreNifs`, which
   has since been removed — see above.)
4. **User provided kentcollege.com as the explicit structural reference**
   — key patterns adopted: a continuous scroll-driven spine, no
   carousel/pagination widgets, photos that break out of rigid rectangles,
   varied section rhythm.
5. **Studio review** (`/website-design meeting` roleplay) diagnosed why an
   early carousel-based attempt read as templated vs. Kent's premium feel.
6. **Two bug-fix passes** on the (now-removed) `ExploreNifs` spine sequence
   — black-gutter-everywhere bug, grid child-ordering bug putting copy
   inside the spine column. Both moot now that the section is gone.
7. **Hero replaced with `ScrollImageTunnel`** — 5 real NIFS photos, tunnel
   scroll-reveal effect, headline overlay on frame 0 only. This part is
   still current — see "Current homepage architecture" above.

## Kent design system parity — token/component cross-check (still accurate)

| Kent has | NIFS equivalent |
|---|---|
| `--color-maroon: #AA0040` spine color | `bg-primary` (NIFS red `#DC1711`) — correctly NOT copied as Kent's literal color |
| `--spine-width-home: 450px` | `SPINE_WIDTH = 450` in `SpineLayout.tsx` — exact match |
| Chevron transparent PNG texture, repeat, `25px 25px` | Inline SVG chevron data-URI in `SpineLayout.tsx`, same effect |
| `.overlap-from-left` / `.overlap-from-right` (120px bleed) | `overlapFromLeft()` / `overlapFromRight()` in `spine-helpers.tsx` |
| `HomepageSpineLayout` wrapping children | `SpineLayout` in `src/components/SpineLayout.tsx` |
| Mobile: hide spine, reset to full-width stack | Handled via `lg:block`/`lg:hidden` splits throughout |

# Historical Archive — superseded architecture (July 10 session)

Everything below this line describes the **previous** homepage build
(scroll-circuit "comet" line, R3F ember-particle hero, India map with
pixel-calibrated city dots) which has since been replaced twice over
(first by the spine/Kent-inspired rebuild, then by this session's further
changes documented above). Kept for reference only — do not treat any of
this as current state without verifying against the actual codebase first.

## 30-Second Brief (OLD)

Rebuilding nifsindia.net as a premium, Gordonstoun-style (gordonstoun.org.uk)
Next.js site for NIFS (National Institute of Fire and Safety), an Indian
industrial-safety and fire-engineering training institute. Brand accent is
NIFS's real red (`#DC1711` in tokens, `#CC0000` used directly on several
newer CTA/accent elements per explicit user spec), not a copied purple.
Positioning is **industrial safety first** — their real recruiters (Adani,
L&T, ITC, GMR, Amazon...) and career outcomes (Safety Officer, HSE Manager,
Risk Analyst) are corporate/industrial roles, not firefighting.

Full design spec lived at:
`C:\Users\user\.claude\plans\please-help-me-create-transient-jellyfish.md`

## Architecture Map (OLD)

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.2.10 (App Router, Turbopack), TypeScript, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui (base-ui, not Radix)
- **Motion**: GSAP + ScrollTrigger (`src/components/sections/story-block.tsx`) + Lenis smooth scroll (`src/components/motion/smooth-scroll-provider.tsx`)
- **3D**: React Three Fiber ember-particle hero layer (`src/components/three/hero-scene.tsx` + `hero-scene-wrapper.tsx`)
- **Content**: static typed data, no CMS — `src/lib/data/courses.ts`, `centers.ts`, `nav.ts`
- **Forms**: `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`, `src/components/sections/enquiry-form.tsx`
- **Crest asset**: `public/images/nifs-crest.png`, wrapped by `src/components/nifs-crest.tsx`

## Key corrected details from that session (still generally useful lessons)

- **Lesson**: when replicating a reference site's motion detail, inspect the
  live DOM/computed styles for the specific element, don't infer the
  mechanic from a screenshot alone.
- **Lesson**: when a user says a screenshot shows something is still wrong,
  re-verify with fresh screenshots across the whole scroll range before
  claiming it's fixed — don't declare victory after only fixing part of the
  issue.
- **Lesson**: when a scroll effect "isn't showing" after geometry/z-index/
  DOM all check out correctly, test color contrast directly (swap to an
  unmistakable debug color, nothing else changed) before assuming a
  browser/rendering bug — much cheaper hypothesis to rule out first.
- **Lesson**: `data-path-target` wrap granularity — mark inner content
  wrappers, not outer full-bleed sections; mark per-item only for ≤4 large
  distinct items; mark whole-section for many small repeated items (card
  grids) to avoid a tangled zigzag of brackets.
- **Positioning correction (industrial safety, not firefighting)** was
  already made once in this old session too — this is the second time it's
  had to be corrected across two different sessions. Do not let it drift
  back a third time, especially in AI-generated imagery prompts.

## Decision Log (OLD, may no longer apply)

- Brand color red `#DC1711`, pixel-sampled from the real logo.
- Crest colors (green/orange) reserved for the emblem motif only.
- No CMS, no existing NIFS backend assumed.
- `ScrollPathLine.tsx` was a standing off-limits-to-edit component (fix
  overlap bugs via `data-path-target` attributes on content, never the
  component itself) — status of this constraint under the NEW architecture
  is unknown/likely moot since the homepage no longer uses it.
- India map: ended on the AI-generated raster version
  (`public/images/india-map.png`), vector alternative preserved at git
  commit `3a71abe` if ever revisited.
